File: index.html
Description: This is the base HTML file for the Speech-to-Text PWA. 
It defines the document structure, sets the meta information, 
loads the React application, and specifies the root element where 
the app will be rendered.

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- 
      Document Encoding
      Specifies UTF-8 as the character encoding for the document. 
      Ensures support for special characters and symbols.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <!-- 
      Favicon
      Sets the favicon (icon displayed in the browser tab) for the application.
      This example uses a `.webp` favicon. Replace `/favorite.io.webp` with 
      the path to your actual favicon file.
    -->
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favorite.io.webp" />

    <!-- 
      Responsive Design
      Sets the viewport for responsive design, ensuring the app scales properly 
      across different devices and screen sizes.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <!-- 
      Page Title
      Sets the title of the application, which appears in the browser tab.
    -->
    <title>Speech 2 Text</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- 
      Root Element
      The root `<div>` where the React application will be mounted. 
      React uses this element to render the application dynamically.
    -->
    <div id="root"></div>

    <!-- 
      Application Entry Point
      Loads the main React application file (`main.jsx`) as a module. 
      The module type allows modern JavaScript features to be used.
    -->
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
